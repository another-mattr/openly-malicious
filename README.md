# Do you trust open source?

Open source is amazing. We don't have to place blind trust on the maintainers. We can read and verify the code for ourselves... or _can we_?

## Consider this repository

This is a simple repository. It does three things:

1. It generates a simple "Hello world ðŸ‘‹" program. [source](/.github/workflows/build_and_release.yml#L15-L16)
2. It cryptographically signs that program to ensure validity. [source](/.github/workflows/build_and_release.yml#L17-L19)
3. It uploads that program and its signature as a release on the repository. [source](/.github/workflows/build_and_release.yml#L20-L27)

Look at the code and verify for yourself. No funny business, right?

Not quite.

## This repository injects unexpected code into the build

Take a look at the `program.sh` from the latest release. There's a little more than "Hello world ðŸ‘‹" in there.

Do you think you could catch this in a code review? I doubt it. ðŸ˜ˆ

Here's my public key:

And here's the command you would run to verify:

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify public_key.pem -signature signature.sig program.sh
```
